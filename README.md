Archive of prior release Figma libraries

After each major update to our Figma libraries (usually aligned to our Now Platform family releases) we'll attach the prior release's libraries here.
We plan to keep "n-2" releases available. For example, once we release the next update to Figma some in early 2024, we'll keep the Utah and Vancouver libraries here.

## Questions
Our focus will always be on the latest available Now Platform release, but if you have questions about the resources here, please ask a question on the [User Experience SIG](https://www.servicenow.com/community/user-experience-special-interest/gh-p/sig-user-experience) on the ServiceNow Community. Make sure to include what release you are working on.
